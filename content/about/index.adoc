As a full-stack software developer with 15 years of experience I have been building full-stack web applications using leading edge technologies involving all application layers. I am an open source committer, conference speaker and developer community organizer. In my prior career, I was an EAI/EDI solution architect focussed on messagng standard such as ANSI X12 and EDIFACT. In 2019 I finished the Kona IRONMAN in Hawaii in 12h 41min.
