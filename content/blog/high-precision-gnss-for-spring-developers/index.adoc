In September, I was presenting at https://springone.io/[SpringOne 2020] on the subject of high-precision GPS for Spring Developers. It was the culmination of several months of research, development and just fun geeking out for a topic that I deeply care about. Below, please find find all the relevant artifacts, such as video recording, slide-deck and links to the demo code.

== Demo Code

For the presentation, I prepared two demos:

- *GNSS NMEA Demo* https://github.com/ghillert/gnss-nmea-demo
- *SpringOne 2020 Plants Demo* https://github.com/ghillert/s1-2020-plants-demo

The second demo is live at https://www.pembana.com.
